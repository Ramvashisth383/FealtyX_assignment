Welcome to the FealtyX Student Management API project. This is a FastAPI-powered RESTful API designed to handle essential CRUD operations for managing student data—allowing users to create, read, update, and delete student records. In addition, it includes AI-based profile summarization through integration with the Ollama model, which generates personalized summaries for each student. This project is built with FastAPI and Python, and it incorporates Ollama’s locally hosted API to process data and return useful summaries.

To get started, ensure you have Python 3.8+ and Ollama installed with the Llama model locally. After cloning this repository, set up a Python virtual environment, activate it, and install all necessary dependencies listed in requirements.txt. Launch the FastAPI server with Uvicorn using the command uvicorn app.main:app --reload and access the interactive API documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs, where each endpoint is documented. The main endpoints allow for adding new students (POST /students), retrieving student lists or specific students by ID (GET /students, GET /students/{id}), updating student data (PUT /students/{id}), deleting students (DELETE /students/{id}), and generating student summaries using Ollama (GET /students/{id}/summary).

The ollama_integration.py file contains the code responsible for connecting to Ollama's API and uses a chunking method to handle large inputs effectively, ensuring that even extensive data can be summarized. Testing is straightforward with pytest, and sample unit tests for each endpoint are available in the tests folder.

Potential future improvements for this project include incorporating a persistent database for long-term data storage, expanding Ollama’s integration to analyze more complex data, and refining error handling for improved API robustness.
